# House Rules

## Description

This application lets a user create an account, read posts about gaming, and write their own posts. 

## User Story

As a Gamer, I want to be able to write a game review, so that I can share secrets and other ways to play.

Our motivation was that we wanted a website where users could leave a review about their favorite games, share secrets, house rules, tips and tricks, and different ways to play.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a game review website, when I log in, then I can interact with other users and their reviews and post my own reviews.

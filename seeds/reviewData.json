New Moon has the size of Kings Canyon but so much more terrain for you or an enemy to camp out, waiting for the next victim. Each part of the map creates interesting battlefields for all, with great loot to save you from your inevitable death. Both normal and Ranked lobbies have their sweats, but with a new map it can level the playing field for the smartest strategist. Hope all are ready and excited to load in and catch a dub.",

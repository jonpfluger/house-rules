At some point we've all played and there have been so many variations of the rules that the original rules get lost in the chaos. Here's a crazy rule taht most people over look, you cannot play more than one card per turn. For example you can't smack your cousin Sarah with 3 plus 4's even if she deserved it. We all know that making up rules to make the time just a little more chaotic is most of the fun, so go however house prefers.",

Both normal and Ranked lobbies have their sweats, but with a new map it can level the playing field for the smartest strategist. Hope all are ready and excited to load in and catch a dub.",
